## About Me

I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student at Purdue University, advised by [Prof. Somali Chaterji](https://schaterji.io/).

My research focuses on data-efficient learning algorithms and deep representation learning for computer vision tasks, such as image semantic segmentation, video classification, and image generation. Additionally, my research interests include multimodal learning, particularly text-to-image diffusion models and video grounding.

Prior to joining Purdue, I was a research assistant at National Taiwan University (NTU), working with [Prof. Ta-Te Lin](http://ttlin.bime.ntu.edu.tw/ttlin). At NTU, I focused on developing embedded devices and machine learning algorithms for precision agriculture. This work involved addressing real-life challenges such as developing interpretable algorithms to assist decision-making, designing user-friendly interfaces for decision support systems, and creating robust machine learning algorithms and edge devices capable of handling outliers and withstanding harsh environments.

In the summers of 2023 and 2024, I interned at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/), working with [Mehrab Tanjim](https://mehrab-tanjim.github.io/). We focused on improving the inference efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models through concept trajectory retrieval.
